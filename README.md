# Hedera Hashgraph Protocol Buffer API Message Definitions

The Hedera Hashgraph API is implemented with protocol buffers, Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. This repository contains the current version of the files used to define the API.

## Documentation

The protobuf files themselves contain detailed comments which help understand not only the message itself but also some of the features and capabilities of the Hedera Hashgraph network.

The `/docs` folder of this project contains automatically generated documents in html and markdown format to help navigate through the message definitions.

* [NestedDoc.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobuf/blob/master/docs/NestedDoc.html) - nested HTML document to help navigate messages that contain other message definitions (large document that takes a while to open)
* [NotNestedDoc.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobuf/blob/master/docs/NotNestedDoc.html) - flat HTML document
* [NotNestedDoc.md](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobuf/blob/master/docs/NotNestedDoc.md) - flat markdown document
